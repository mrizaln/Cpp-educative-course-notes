// In layman’s terms, data hiding refers to the concept of hiding the inner workings of a class and simply providing
// an interface through which the outside world can interact with the class without knowing what’s going on inside.

// Data hiding can be divided into two primary components:
    // Encapsulation
    // Abstraction
