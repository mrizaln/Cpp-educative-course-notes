// In the last lesson, we have seen that Vehicle class attributes are shared by the other two classes(Car and Ship).
    // We can consider the Vehicle class as a base class as it has common attributes.
    // Car and Ship are considered as derived classes as theyâ€™re inheriting properties from vehicle class.

// Modes of Inheritance#
    // There are three modes of class inheritance: public, private and protected. The basic syntax for inheritance is given below:

        //    class derivedClassName : modeOfInheritance baseClassName

    // We use the keyword public to implement public inheritance.
    // Now, the class Car has access to the public members of a base class vehicle and the protected data is inherited as protected data, and the private data is not inherited, but it can be accessed directly by the public member functions of the class.
