// We can inherit the base class attributes to the derived class if we want derived class to have access data members and
// member functions of the base class. But to inherit multiple classes data members and member functions to the derived,
// the concept of multiple inheritance comes in. 

// We can inherit multiple classes as base classes separated by ,
    //  class Derived : public Base1, public Base2, ...
