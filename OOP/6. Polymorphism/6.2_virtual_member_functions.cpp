// Virtual means existing in appearance but not in reality.

// A virtual function is a member function which is declared within the base class and is overridden by the
// derived class. When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class,
// you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the function.

// Virtual functions ensure that the correct function is called for an object, regardless of the type of
// reference (or pointer) used for the function call. They are mainly used to achieve Runtime polymorphism.
// Functions are declared with a virtual keyword in a base class. The function resolution call is done at run-time.
